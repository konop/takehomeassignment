Hello <interviewee>,

The next step in the interview process is a code challenge. You will have 90 minutes to complete the challenge. Please reply to this email with a time that works for you. We will send the instructions at that time. Please keep the following in mind:

* Make sure to have a reliable internet connection
* Make sure to have Xcode 10 installed
* The challenge will involve an iOS app written in Swift. Take time to refresh on that if you need to.

Sincerely,
<interviewers>
